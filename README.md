Built With:   
React.js – Frontend Framework

Ethereum / Solidity – Smart Contracts

Ganache / Web3.js – Blockchain Testing

Truffle – Contract Deployment

MetaMask – Wallet Integration  

JSON Server (mocked backend) – User Auth (register/login)

Static Image Support – Image selection from public folder

Cart System – Add/Remove items with quantity control

Admin Mode – Product creation, removal, and sales dashboard

Smart Contract (Solidity)

function purchaseProduct(uint _id, string memory _buyerName, uint _quantity) public payable {
    require(_quantity > 0 && _quantity <= product.stock, "Invalid quantity");
    require(msg.value >= product.price * _quantity, "Insufficient payment");

    product.stock -= _quantity;
    totalSales += msg.value;

    emit ProductPurchased(_id, msg.sender, _buyerName, _quantity, msg.value);
}
