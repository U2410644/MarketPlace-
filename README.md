# Decentralized Marketplace DApp (with Basket & Admin Management)

A full-stack Ethereum-based Decentralized Application (DApp) that allows customers to browse and purchase products using MetaMask, while enabling admin users to manage products, stock, and images with a real-time blockchain backend.

## Build With

- Fetch weather data for any city.
- React.js – Frontend Framework
- Ethereum / Solidity – Smart Contracts

- Implemented using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.
- API documentation using Swagger (OpenAPI Specification).
- Test API endpoints with Postman.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-api.git
  cd weather-api
```

Now install the dependencies.

```bash
    npm install
```

## Run in Development

To run the Weather API in a development environment, follow these steps:

Start the TypeScript Compiler in Watch Mode:

- Open a terminal in the project root directory.
- Run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode, which will compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript in real-time as you make changes.

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

Start the Development Server:

- Open another terminal while the first one is still running.
- Run the development server, which will use the compiled JavaScript files.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This setup allows you to actively develop and test your application with live updates as you save your TypeScript files.

## Run Locally

For local running of the Weather API, especially in a production-like environment, follow these steps:

Compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript.

```bash
  npm run build

```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
